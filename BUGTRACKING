gbsplay uses ditz <http://ditz.rubyforge.org> as a bug and issue tracking
system.  We use the stable ditz version (currently 0.5).

New issues should be send as merge requests of ditz issues or can simply be
reported via email to the developer's mailing list at
<gbsplay-dev@lists.uguu.de>.

gbsplay's ditz status page is located at
