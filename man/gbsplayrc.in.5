.TP
.B Boolean

.RS
.IP \fBnative\fP
native endian
.IP \fBlittle\fP
little endian
.IP \fBbig\fP

.TP
.B Plugin
The name of an output plugin.
Run `\fIgbsplay\ \-o\ list\fP' to get a list of all available output plugins.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR endian " = " \fIEndian\fP
Set the output endianness.
.TP
.BR fadeout " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the fadeout time in seconds.
Instead of cutting the subsong off hard, do a soft fadeout.
.TP
.BR loop " = " \fIBoolean\fP
Set the loop mode to "\fBrange\fP" when enabled.
Set the loop mode to "\fBnone\fP" when disabled.
Deprecated in favor of the \fBloop_mode\fP option.
.TP
.BR loop_mode " = " \fILoop\ mode\fP
Set the desired loop mode.
.TP
.BR output_plugin " = " \fIPlugin\fP
Set the sound output plugin.
.TP
.BR rate " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the samplerate in Hz.
.TP
.BR refresh_delay " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the refresh delay in milliseconds.
Larger values will lower CPU usage, but things as subsong changes,
fadeouts, reactions to keypresses and the on\-screen display
will be delayed.
.TP
.BR silence_timeout " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the silence timeout in seconds.
When a subsong contains silence for the given time,
the player will skip to the next subsong.
.TP
.BR subsong_gap " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the subsong gap in seconds.
Before playing the next subsong after the subsong timeout,
\fIsubsong_gap\fP seconds of silence will be played.
.TP
.BR subsong_timeout " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the subsong timeout in seconds.
When a subsong has been played for the given time,
the player will skip to the next subsong.
A timeout of 0 seconds disables automatic subsong changes.
.TP
.BR verbosity " = " \fIInteger\fP
Set the verbosity level (default: 3).
A value of 0 means no messages on stdout.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I /etc/gbsplayrc
Default location of the global configuration file.
.TP
.I ~/.gbsplayrc
User configuration file.

# select NAS output plugin and play subsongs for at most 5 minutes
output_plugin = nas
subsong_timeout = 300
