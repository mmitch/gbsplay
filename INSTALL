gbsplay INSTALL instructions


### BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

Run "make".  This should autoconfigure and build all files.

Run "make install" (as root) to install everything to your system.
Run "make uninstall" (as root) to remove it afterwards.

Be aware that you need a GNU make!
So on FreeBSD, you need to run "gmake" instead of "make".

Note to Solaris users:
Solaris /bin/sh is not POSIX compatible (${foo#bar} and ${foo%bar} are
not supported), please change the first line of configure to from /bin/sh
to /usr/bin/ksh.


### CUSTOMIZING THE INSTALLATION TARGET

To change the installation target, run the configure script manually
and pass some parameters (see "./configure --help" for a list):

$ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/GBSPLAY
$ make
$ make install

Remember to use the same prefix on uninstall!
